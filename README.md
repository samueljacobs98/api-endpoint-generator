# API Endpoint Generator

On HMRC MTD API, many endpoints share a lot of generic "boilerplate" code. This repository is a POC for a generator script that can generate the boiler plate for an entire endpoint, including specs, using consistent naming and placing files in the appropriate places via command line inputs.

## Running the script

python3 generator_all.py new_endpoint_2 v1
